# Lightweight Freeze Macro

A minimal, resource-efficient background process that provides only the freeze/lag macro functionality from Spencer Macro Utilities, without the heavy UI overhead.

## Features

- **Minimal Resource Usage**: No GUI, runs efficiently in background
- **Customizable Keybinds**: Configure any key for freeze/unfreeze
- **Adjustable Timing**: Customizable FPS-based timing for optimal performance  
- **Safety Features**: Auto-unfreeze to prevent disconnections
- **Toggle or Hold Modes**: Choose between toggle and hold-to-freeze behavior
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple text-based configuration file
- **Real-time Control**: Interactive console commands while running

## Quick Start

1. **Build the executable:**
   ```cmd
   build_freeze_macro.bat
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```cmd
   freeze_macro.exe
   ```

3. **Configure settings** (optional):
   - Edit `freeze_macro_config.txt` after first run
   - Or type `config` while the program is running

## Configuration Options

All settings are stored in `freeze_macro_config.txt`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `freeze_key` | `0x04` (Middle Mouse) | Key to trigger freeze (hex format) |
| `max_freeze_time` | `9.0` | Auto-unfreeze after this many seconds |
| `unfreeze_duration` | `50` | Milliseconds to unfreeze for safety |
| `toggle_mode` | `false` | `true` = toggle on/off, `false` = hold to freeze |
| `freeze_outside_roblox` | `true` | Allow freezing when not focused on target |
| `take_all_processes` | `false` | Freeze all instances or just the newest |
| `target_fps` | `120` | Target FPS for timing calculations |
| `process_name` | `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` | Target process name |

### Common Key Codes
- `0x01` = Left Mouse Button
- `0x02` = Right Mouse Button  
- `0x04` = Middle Mouse Button
- `0x20` = Spacebar
- `0x11` = Ctrl key
- `0x10` = Shift key

## Console Commands

While running, you can type these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` or `h` | Show help information |
| `status` or `s` | Display current status and configuration |
| `config` | Open configuration file for editing |
| `reload` | Reload configuration from file |
| `quit` or `q` | Exit the program |

## How It Works

### Freeze Mechanism
- Uses Windows NT `NtSuspendProcess`/`NtResumeProcess` functions
- Completely pauses the target process (all threads)
- Preserves game state perfectly when unfrozen

### Safety Features
- **Auto-unfreeze**: Prevents disconnection by briefly unfreezing after `max_freeze_time`
- **Clean exit**: Automatically unfreezes process when program closes
- **Process detection**: Only operates when target process is found

### Performance
- **Low CPU**: Checks for input at configurable FPS rate
- **Minimal memory**: No GUI libraries, simple data structures
- **Background operation**: Runs without interfering with other applications

## Build Requirements

Choose one of these compilers:

- **Visual Studio** (recommended)
  - Install "Desktop development with C++" workload
  - Includes MSVC compiler and Windows SDK

- **MinGW-w64** or **MSYS2**
  - Provides g++ compiler for Windows
  - Download from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)

- **LLVM/Clang**
  - Cross-platform C++ compiler
  - Download from [llvm.org](https://llvm.org/)

## Troubleshooting

### "No suitable C++ compiler found"
- Install Visual Studio with C++ tools, MinGW-w64, or LLVM/Clang
- Make sure the compiler is in your system PATH

### "Process not found"
- Check that `process_name` in config matches your target exactly
- For non-Roblox games, update the process name in config

### "Freeze not working"
- Run as Administrator if target process requires elevated privileges
- Verify the freeze key code is correct in the config file
- Check that `freeze_outside_roblox` setting matches your usage

### High CPU usage
- Increase `target_fps` value to reduce polling frequency
- Values between 60-120 FPS are recommended
